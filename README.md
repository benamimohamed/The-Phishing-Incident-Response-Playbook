# THE PHISHING INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAYBOOK 
# 1st step Preparation : 
Firstly, it's vital to determine the teams and roles involved in the incident response process.Clearly defined roles and responsabilities provide structure,reduce confusion, and ensure a swift and effective response.
Three critical teams are generally involved : the Incident Response Team (IRT) who coordinate the entire process, the IT Team, who ensure technical aspects are covered, and SOC Team, who monitor and analyse activity on networks,servers,endpoints,databases,applications,websites, and other systems, looking for anomalous activity that could be indicative of a security incident or compromise.
Now that our teams are in place and fully prapared, we are ready to pass to the next step.
